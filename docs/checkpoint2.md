# Checkpoint 2 - Optimization libraries and software

### Optimization Libraries

1. AD Model Builder - suite for non-linear statistical modeling. The "AD" refers to the automatic differentiation capabilities that come from the AUTODIF Library, a C++ language extension (same author),
which implements reverse mode automatic differentiation. A related software package, ADMB-RE, provides additional support for modeling random effects. Useful for Bayesian modeling

2.  CUTEr - testing environment for optimization and linear algebra solvers. CUTEr provides a collection of test problems along with a set of tools to help developers design, compare, and improve new and existing test problem solvers:
* linear programming,
* convex and nonconvex quadratic programming,
* linear and nonlinear least squares, and
* more general convex and nonconvex large-scale and sparse equality and inequality-constrained nonlinear programming.

### EPANET System

**Basic Information:**

</p>

* License: MIT License
* Latest version: [EPANET 2.2.0 from 24th July 2020](https://github.com/USEPA/EPANET2.2/releases/tag/2.2.0)

**Launching the system**

*Author's note: When launching the system in both cases we used the example network from the tutorial provided on [read the docs of EPANET](https://epanet22.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_quickstart.html).*
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/example_pws_network.png" height="200"/>
</p>

The installation process was super simple and consisted of downloading the installation wizard and following its instructions.\
When following the tutorial we've also established some default values as follows:
* **ID Labels/ID increment**: 1
* **Hydraulics/Flow Units**: GPM (gallons per minute) - *might later be changed to LPM (liters per minute) to match our data and metric system better*
* **Hydraulics/Headloss Formula**: H-W (Hazen-Williams [described more here](https://epanet22.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3_network_model.html))

**with GUI**

After the set-up we drew the network in the GUI and then exported it to source file in [binary](/knowledge_sources/epanet_usage_examples/example_network.net) or [readable](/knowledge_sources/epanet_usage_examples/example_network_readable.inp) version that we could use later when launching the app from the command line (useful feature).
The ability to create your network in GUI really makes your life easier as the file representing it has a lot of options and requires high level of understanding of the system.
However, it's also worth mentioning that there is a certain amount of effort required to understand and learn the tool regardless of the way you want to use it, 
as the networks and the tasks simulated by the tool can get really complex.

Later on, following the tutorial, we ran a Single Period Analysis and an Extended Period Analysis

Because the network properties were different in tutorial's tables and texts as well as different from command line tutorial example input file, it was hard to obtain a coherent model. 
This resulted in warnings during the Extended Period Simulation

**from the command line**

The system can be launched from the command line with the following command:

```runepanet  inpfile  rptfile  outfile```

where:
* **inpfile** - input file with network parameters in the same format as a [readable](/knowledge_sources/epanet_usage_examples/example_network_readable.inp) version exported from GUI. The format of the file is described in depth [here](https://epanet22.readthedocs.io/en/latest/back_matter.html#input-file-format)
* **rptfile** - output report file, which yields the result of EPA ran with settings specified in an input file
* **outfile** - optional binary output file that stores the result in a special binary format

As written, the above command assumes that you are working in the directory in which EPANET was installed or that this directory has been added to the system PATH variable. 
Otherwise full pathnames for the executable runepanet.exe and the files on the command line must be used.


We tried this version of launch for the example network created when using the GUI. The command was as seen below:

```runepanet D:\sem8\MiSS\projekt\MiSS-EPANET-Leaks-in-waterworks-research-project\knowledge_sources\example_network_readable.inp D:\sem8\MiSS\projekt\MiSS-EPANET-Leaks-in-waterworks-research-project\knowledge_sources\example_network_readable_report.txt```

And the command line output was as follows

**System's output**

The report file obtained from command line launch of the system can be seen [here](/knowledge_sources/epanet_usage_examples/example_network_readable_report.txt). The amount of information can vary depending on the configuration
of the [REPORT] section in the input file.

**How can we use the system for our problem**

The main idea is to reach conclusions about the locations of the leaks by comparing the actual data from the waterworks with the results of EPANET EPA.
If there are differences in the compared data we can model the behaviour of the leak ([section 2.1 in the linked paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326823790_Pre-Localization_Approach_of_Leaks_on_a_Water_Distribution_Network_by_Optimization_of_the_Hydraulic_Model_Using_an_Evolutionary_Algorithm#pf2)) in place where we suspect it in EPANET network and run the analysis again.
By repeating this process until we reach the desired equality of the simulated & real data we can to some extent locate the leaks and get to know their severeness.

The [linked paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326823790_Pre-Localization_Approach_of_Leaks_on_a_Water_Distribution_Network_by_Optimization_of_the_Hydraulic_Model_Using_an_Evolutionary_Algorithm#pf2) provides its own idea on how to pre-locate
the leaks and how to estimate them with the usage of Genetic Algorithms. The parameters to be compared proposed by the paper are the pressure and the flow rate in junctions / measure points.

[Another paper](https://dwes.copernicus.org/articles/13/29/2020/dwes-13-29-2020.pdf) bases their leak pre-location on a Random Forrest machine-learning algorithm, but the training data it uses is obtained through
a very similar method to the one described in the former work.

### Summary

* EPANET is a tool that allows us to build a network from a variety of components including tanks, reservoirs, pipes and junctions.
* Each of these components has various properties that can be customized to our need
* On such network we can run extended period analysis which will simulate the behaviour of the network based on established demand patterns that can be different for different parts of the waterworks
* Then we can inspect the results of the analysis through various tools such as tables, graphs and a simple visualization or generate a complete textual report of the analysis
* When launching the system from the command line all network and analysis parameters have to be included in the input file which "manages" the analysis process
* The output of cmd launch is a report file which contents are based on the \[REPORT] section in the input file.
* Based on this report we can formulate hypothesis about the system including comparing the report with the actual data to try and locate the leaks in the waterworks
