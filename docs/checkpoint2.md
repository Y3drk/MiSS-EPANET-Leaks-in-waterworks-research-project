# Optimization libraries and software

1. AD Model Builder - suite for non-linear statistical modeling. The "AD" refers to the automatic differentiation capabilities that come from the AUTODIF Library, a C++ language extension (same author),
which implements reverse mode automatic differentiation. A related software package, ADMB-RE, provides additional support for modeling random effects. Useful for Bayesian modeling

2.  CUTEr - testing environment for optimization and linear algebra solvers. CUTEr provides a collection of test problems along with a set of tools to help developers design, compare, and improve new and existing test problem solvers:
* linear programming,
* convex and nonconvex quadratic programming,
* linear and nonlinear least squares, and
* more general convex and nonconvex large-scale and sparse equality and inequality-constrained nonlinear programming.
