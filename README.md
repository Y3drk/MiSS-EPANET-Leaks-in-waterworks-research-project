# MiSS-EPANET-Leaks-in-waterworks-research-project
A project aimed at researching and solving the problem of leaks in waterworks in Polish cities based on the EPANET water distribution systems simulation tool.
It's developed in cooperation with another [project](https://github.com/michwoj01/Computation-Intelligence---EPANET-optimization), thus sharing some of the documentation and code

### Checkpoints

Besides code, all notes made for each checkpoint will be placed in the [docs directory](docs)

Roadmap of checkpoints:
1. [Domain and Problem Analysis](docs/checkpoint1.md) ***CURRENT STATE***
2. Analysis of EPANET simulator
3. Test launching of the simulator and confirmation of the objectives and the scope of work
4. Prototype and first working elements
5. Progress with the prototype
6. RC: achieved goals, results of the tests and analysis of those results
