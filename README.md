# MiSS-EPANET-Leaks-in-waterworks-research-project
A project aimed at researching and solving the problem of leaks in waterworks in Polish cities based on the EPANET water distribution systems simulation tool.
It's developed simultaneously for two separate courses focusing on simulation and optimization aspects respectively.

### Checkpoints

Besides code, all notes made for each checkpoint will be placed in the [docs directory](docs)

Roadmap of checkpoints:
1. [Domain and Problem Analysis](docs/checkpoint1.md) 
2. [Analysis of EPANET simulator and optimization libraries](docs/checkpoint2.md)
3. [Test launching of the simulator and confirmation of the objectives and the scope of work](docs/checkpoint3.md)
4. [Prototype and first working elements](docs/checkpoint4.md)
5. [Progress with the prototype](docs/checkpoint5.md) 
6. [RC: achieved goals, results of the tests and analysis of those results](docs/checkpoint6.md) ***FINISHED***

### Structure of repository

- `docs` - directory with notes and reports for each checkpoint
- `src` - directory with scripts used in the project and unfinished spike with swarm algorithm
- `knowledge_sources` - directory with user guide, input data for algoritm (`real_life_network_data`) and our results from each checkpoint
- `EPANET-2.2.0-Linux` - directory with EPANET toolkit for Linux (if you want to run algorithm locally)
